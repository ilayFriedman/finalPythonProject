# From Yelp Dataset to Business Insight

This assignment was done during the Fall semster of 2019-2020, as part of a Principals of Programming Languages course in Ben Gurion University.
In this repository you can find the given assignment, and the different files we created.

We took it upon ourselves to use the Yelp.com dataset in order to provide business owners insights that can be mined 
from the numerous reviews published on Yelp.

The system has the following basic functionality:
  1. Create a pie graph of positive and negative reviews of the business - using sentiment analysis.
  2. Get a concise summary of the positive and negative reviews - using topic modeling.
  3. Get a summary of the positive and negative reviews similar businesses have received. Similairity was determined by the categories assigned to each business, and by geographical distance.
  
  
 Future Work:
  -In topic modeling:
    * Replace tfidf encoding with Doc2Vec
    * Replace clustering with LDA
